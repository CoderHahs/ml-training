# Machine Learning Repository

This repo serves as a playground for all my experimentation in different techniques used in ML. Since I'm quite new to Data Science and have recently gotten work experience with the Analytics part of Data Science, I want to dive into ML.

## Notebooks:

### NLP, TF-IDF and LDA

A notebook that implements topical modeling using LDA and two different measures of the importance of a word, Bag of Words and TF-IDF.

Find the notebook here: [nlp_tfidf_lda.ipynb](ml-training/nlp_tfidf_lda.ipynb)
