# Machine Learning Repository
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/CoderHahs/ml-training/master)

This repo serves as a playground for all my experimentation with different techniques used in ML. Since I'm quite new to Data Science and have recently gotten work experience with the Analytics part of Data Science, I want to dive into ML.

## Structure

1. **Knowledge**
  - **NLP** - contains all notebooks & datasets related to Natural Language Processing
    - Datasets
    - Notebooks
      - [nlp_tfidf_lda.ipynb](Knowledge/NLP/Notebooks/nlp_tfidf_lda.ipynb)
  - **AI** - contains all notebooks related to Artificial Intelligence
    - Notebooks
      - [fuzzy_logic.ipynb](Knowledge/AI/Fuzzy%20Logic/fuzzy_logic.ipynb)
      - [graph_search.ipynb](Knowledge/AI/Graph%20Search/graph_search.ipynb)

      - [Titanic-EDA.ipynb](Kaggle/Titanic/Notebooks/Titanic-EDA.ipynb)
3. **Projects** - contains all Data Science Projects
  - COVID-19 Dashboard - a dashboard created to monitor the Coronavirus Pandemic. Created using Plotly, Dash, and Heroku. View the dashboard at [covid19-report.herokuapp.com](https://covid19-report.herokuapp.com)
    - [covid-app](Projects/covid-app-nogit)
