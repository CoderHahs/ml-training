# Machine Learning Repository
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/CoderHahs/ml-training/master)

This repo serves as a playground for all my experimentation with different techniques used in ML. Since I'm quite new to Data Science and have recently gotten work experience with Analytics and the basics of ML, I want to explore the field further.

## Structure

1. **Knowledge**
  - **NLP** - contains all notebooks & datasets related to Natural Language Processing
    - Datasets
    - Notebooks
      - [nlp_tfidf_lda.ipynb](Knowledge/NLP/Notebooks/nlp_tfidf_lda.ipynb)
  - **AI** - contains all notebooks related to Artificial Intelligence
    - Notebooks
      - [fuzzy_logic.ipynb](Knowledge/AI/Fuzzy%20Logic/fuzzy_logic.ipynb)
      - [graph_search.ipynb](Knowledge/AI/Graph%20Search/graph_search.ipynb)
2.  **Kaggle** - contains everything used for Kaggle Competitions
  - Titanic - competition to classify whether a passenger would survive the disaster. Overall accuracy of 75%.
      - [Titanic-EDA.ipynb](Kaggle/Titanic/Notebooks/Titanic-EDA.ipynb)
3. **Projects** - contains all Data Science Projects
