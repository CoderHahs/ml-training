    "***INTRODUCTION***:\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervised classification task tackled in this notebook is to determine whether a passenger survived or did not survive on the Titanic. This is a common introductory problem to supervised machine learning and is a challenge on a popular site called Kaggle. Kaggle contains competitions that users can compete in. These competitions typical provide a dataset to work with and a description of the problem to solve. That said, not all datasets will include the ground truth for the test set. Or, a competition may only provide a training and validation set, not the test set. This means that users will not know how their models perform on the real unseen data until the host(s) test the user's submission on the private test set, posting the results.    \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will expand your knowledge from the previous notebook and will introduce the concept of dealing with class imabalance through the use of a technique called oversampling. You will also see how a dataset can have issues with its data and that not every feature should be used to train and test a model. You will also perform the training, testing, and evaluation in slightly new ways since we will be working with a different type of dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, this notebook uses **scikit-learn** (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), **Matplot**, **Numpy**, and **Pandas**. However, we will also be using **imblearn** which provides robust techniques for balancing the number of instances of different classes. To install this packge, use the command ***pip install imbalanced-learn***. If this causes any issues you can also try *pip install imblearn*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use the Naive Bayes algorithm and the Logistic Regression algorithm to perform the classification for this problem. After evaluating both models, you will determine which performed better, and why. Finally, you will go through the process once more to determine whether or not a common oversampling technique will improve the results obtained.    "

This data is included with the notebook and can be found from Kaggle, which also contains a description of the data that we will be working with (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It is highly recommended that you take a quick look at the Data Dictionary within the Overview section that is available by the link above. This will help you understand the data that we will be working with.     \n",
    "\n",
    "As alluded to in the introduction, this Kaggle competition only provides annotated training data, while the testing data is unannotated. The ground truth of the the test dataset can be found online, but we will focus on only using the training dataset to create and test our model. This will provide a different type of Machine Learning experiment process for you to go through.       \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many cases where a competition will only give a training set, so we will try to learn whether a passenger did or did not survive on the Titanic from this training data."

    "From the above, we can see a variety of columns. Out of these columns, the ***Survived*** column represents the class values that we wish to predict. A passenger survived from the Titanic if *Survived* is 1 and did not survive from the Titanic if *Survived* is 0. These are our two classes that we will predict (1 and 0). The other columns represent potential features that can be used by the Machine Learning algorithms to learn how to accurately predict the target class.   \n",
    "\n",
    "One important note from the data above is that not every sample contains data for each column. For example, Passenger 6 (Moran, Mr. James) does not contain a value for their *Age* and does not contain the *Cabin* that they were residing in. Since Machine Learning algorithms learn from data, a Data Scientist will need to learn how to accurately fill in the missing data. Robust methods of doing this is beyond the scope of this notebook, but we will be filling in most of the missing data later on through simple means.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Another note is that it is important to consider whether one class is seen more frequently than another class within the data. A class with the most instances is called the *majority* class and a class with least instances is called the *minority* class. If one class contains more instances than another class, the algorithm may focus on learning that majority class more than the minority class. In problems such as cancer diagnosis, this is a major problem (since many more people do not have cancer). Thus, another issue that we will explore in this notebook is the concept of using oversampling  to balance the class distribution. This concept will be explained in detail later in the notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a plot of the number of instances for each class. In this scenario, based on the data available from the training set, more people did not survive on the Titanic than those who did survive (as we would expect in this scenario). Since we cannot simply collect more data on passenger's who survived the Titanic, we will need to think of ways to balance the class distribution."
